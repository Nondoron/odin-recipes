    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The traditional preparation method includes three steps. The first one is soaking the beans in water overnight. 
        However, if you don’t have this much time, soaking for 2-3 hours should be enough.The next step includes boiling the beans along with 
        the other vegetables for 2-3 hours on medium heat. After the food is boiled, the mix is poured in a <strong>Tava</strong> (local iron skillet) 
        and cooked on a wooden oven for 2 more hours until the mix is not liquid anymore. </p>
