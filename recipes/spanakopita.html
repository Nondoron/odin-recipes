        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F / 180 C.
        </li>
        <li>Drain the spinach to remove the excess liquid.</li>
        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan and saut√© the onions and spinach over high heat for 5 minutes, 
            stirring constantly. Set aside until cool.</li>
        <li>Put spinach and onions in a large bowl, add dill and parsley and mix well by mashing with the hands or with a potato masher. 
            The volume is reduced by half.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients, except olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and mix well. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>

        <li>Place a sheet of phyllo dough, oiled lightly and proceed in the same way for all the remaining sheets.</li>
        <li>Fold the edges and oil the surface of the last sheet. Press on the pie. Draw portions with a knife at the surface.</li>
        <li>Bake for about thirty minutes, until golden brown.</li>
        <li>To get a crispy dough that may have softened the next day, bake the leftover pie for a few minutes.</li>
